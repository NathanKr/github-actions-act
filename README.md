<h2>Motivation</h2>

You start developing the workflow and want to check that it is working correctly. However, you have several constraints:

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fast Feedback</strong>: Rapidly identify and resolve issues locally, accelerating the development cycle.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced GitHub Pollution</strong>: Avoid unnecessary workflow runs and clutter in your repository's history.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost Control</strong>: Eliminate GitHub Actions usage costs by running workflows locally.</li>
  </ul>



The solution is to run it locally using nektos/act. But how do you do it? That's the motivation.
